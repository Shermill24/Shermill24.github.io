        a lot of effort—just the kind of recipe I love to share!

    <h2> Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            12 ounces spaghetti, fettuccine, or tagliatelle
        </li>   
        <li>
            2 whole eggs
        </1i>
        <li>
            4 egg yolks
        </li>
        <li>
            1 1/2 cups freshly grated parmesan
        </li>  
        <li>
            1/2 teaspoon black pepper, plus more to taste
        </li>   
        <li>
            8 ounces beef bacon, cut into small pieces
        </1i>
        <li>
            1/2 teaspoon brown sugar
        </li>
        <li>
            2 teaspoons minced garlic
        </li>  
        <li>
            1/2 to 2/3 cup pasta water (reserved from cooking the pasta)
        </li>   
        <li>
            1/3 cup green peas (optional)
        </1i>
        <li>
            salt, to taste
        </li>
        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <p>
            <sup>{1}</sup>  <b>Cook the Pasta:</b> Bring a large pot of salted water to a 
                boil. Add the pasta and cook according to the package 
                instructions until al dente. Reserve about 1 cup of the pasta 
                water before draining.
        </p>
        <p>
            <sup>{2}</sup>  <b>Prepare the Sauce</b> In a large bowl, whisk together
                 the eggs, egg yolks, freshly grated parmesan, and black pepper 
                 until smooth and well combined. Set aside.
        </p>
        <p><sup>{3}</sup>  <b>Cook the Bacon:</b> In a large skillet over medium 
            heat, cook the beef bacon with garlic and brown sugar until crispy, 
            about 5-7 minutes. Transfer the cooked bacon to a bowl on the side, 
            leaving the bacon fat in the pan.
        </p>
        <p>
            <sup>{4}</sup>  <b>Combine Bacon Fat with Egg Mixture:</b> Carefully
             pour the hot bacon fat into the bowl with the egg and parmesan 
             mixture, whisking constantly to combine. Then, temper the egg 
             mixture by slowly adding a bit of the reserved pasta water at a 
             time until you get a creamy thick consistency, whisking to avoid 
             scrambling the eggs. Don't add all the pasta water or your sauce 
             will be too thin. You can always add more later.
        </p>
        <p>
            <sup>{5}</sup>  <b>Cook the Carbonara:</b> Pour the tempered egg 
            mixture back into the skillet. Cook over low heat, stirring 
            constantly until the sauce thickens and becomes creamy. Note: Stir 
            well and make sure the heat is not too high to prevent the sauce 
            from curdling.
        </p>
        <p>
            <sup>{6}</sup>  <b>Combine and Serve:</b> Add the cooked pasta back 
            to the pan with the sauce. Toss everything together until the pasta 
            is well coated. Then, add the cooked bacon and green peas, mixing 
            until well combined. Season with salt and additional black pepper to
            taste. Serve immediately with extra parmesan if desired. Enjoy!
