        <p>   <b>Crown shyness</b><i>(also canopy disengagement,</i><sup>[1]</sup> 
            canopy shyness,<sup>[2]</sup> or inter-crown spacing<sup>[3]</sup>) 
            is a phenomenon observed in some tree species, in which the crowns 
            of fully stocked trees do not touch each other, forming a canopy with 
            channel-like gaps.[4][5] The phenomenon is most prevalent among trees 
            of the same species, but also occurs between trees of different 
            species.<sup>[6]</sup><sup>[7]</sup> There exist many hypotheses as 
            to why crown shyness is an adaptive behavior, and research suggests 
            that it might inhibit spread of leaf-eating insect larvae.<sup[8]></sup>

        <h3>    Possible physiological explanations</h3>
        <hr>
        <p>
                The exact physiological basis of crown shyness is uncertain.<sup>
            [6]</sup>The phenomenon has been discussed in scientific 
            literature since the 1920s.<sup>[9]</sup>The variety of 
            hypotheses and experimental results might suggest that there are
            multiple mechanisms across different species, an example of 
            <i>convergent evolution</i>.<sup>[citation needed]</sup>
        </p>
        <p>
                Some hypotheses contend that the interdigitation of canopy 
            branches leads to "reciprocal pruning" of adjacent trees: trees in 
            windy areas suffer physical damage as they collide with each other 
            during winds; the abrasions and collisions induce a crown shyness 
            response. Studies suggest that lateral branch growth is largely 
            uninfluenced by neighbours until disturbed by mechanical abrasion.
            <sup>[10]</sup> If the crowns are artificially prevented from 
            colliding in the winds, they gradually fill the canopy gaps.<sup>[11]</sup> 
            This explains instances of crown shyness between branches of the 
            same organism. Proponents of this idea cite that shyness is 
            particularly seen in conditions conducive to this pruning, including 
            windy forests, stands offlexible trees, and early succession forests 
            where branches are flexible and limited in lateral movement.<sup>[6]</sup><sup>[12]</sup> 
            According to this theory, variable flexibility in lateral branches 
            greatly influences the degree of crown shyness.
